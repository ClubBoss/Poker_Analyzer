# Curriculum Structure

## Overview
The Poker Analyzer curriculum is designed as a branching path:
- **Core** (mandatory fundamentals for all players).
- **Cash** (independent path for cash game development).
- **MTT** (independent path for tournaments).
- **Heads-Up (HU)** (independent branch unlocked after Core).
- **Specials / Meta** (optional advanced modules, unlocked after main branches).

This structure ensures smooth progression, minimal jargon, and step-by-step introduction of complexity.

---

## Branching Principles
- **Core** is required for everyone before branching.
- **Cash** and **MTT** are equal, parallel branches. Players may choose either path after Core.
- **HU** is independent: unlocked once the learner has completed Core and at least one pack of Cash or MTT.
- **Specials** are meta/advanced modules, optional but recommended for mastery.

---

## Style Principles
- **Audience**: user-friendly, amateur-friendly, mobile-first.
- **Clarity**: avoid unexplained jargon; every technical term must be defined the first time it appears.
- **Why & How**: each rule of thumb and common mistake must explain not only what, but also why it matters.
- **Gradual buildup**: start from basics, add complexity progressively. Donâ€™t overload with math or solver jargon too early.
- **Contextual notes**: clarify when advice applies differently for live vs online.

## Notes on Hybrids
Some batches mix modules from different paths (e.g. Batch 12: Cash + MTT). This is intentional for content density and thematic grouping, but **learner progression should branch correctly in-app**.

## Usage
- **Research chat** uses this file to generate correct content batches.  
- **Zip chat** packages and validates content, ensuring alignment with this structure.  
- **App logic** enforces progression rules based on branch unlocks.
