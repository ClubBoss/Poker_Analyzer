# Style Guide for Content Generation

We now operate in **single-module mode only**. Batch mode is deprecated.

## General Rules

- Audience and tone must be explicitly tailored per module.
- Theory.md word count: 450â€“550.
- Demos: concise, single-line steps.
- Drills: compact, rationale <= 1 line.
- ASCII-only output, no smart quotes/dashes.
- JSONL: line-delimited, unique IDs.

## Module-Specific Overrides

For each module, the **STYLE OVERRIDE** must declare:
- Audience (beginner, intermediate, advanced, live/online, etc.)
- Tone (friendly, professional, coach-like, academic, etc.)
- Any special pedagogical rules (e.g., emphasize math clarity, live game anecdotes, solver framing).

## Examples

### Core fundamentals
- Audience: user-friendly, amateur-friendly, mobile-first
- Tone: conversational but structured
- Emphasis: practical rules of thumb

### Math modules
- Audience: intermediate players
- Tone: precise, didactic
- Emphasis: formulas + mini examples, avoid jargon overload

### Advanced/solver modules
- Audience: advanced grinders
- Tone: analytical, professional
- Emphasis: structured reasoning, solver workflow
