content: |-
  After mastering push/fold play, the next frontier is deciding which hands to open when everyone folds to you in a 6-max cash game.
  Facing a standard 3bb raise, understanding open/fold decisions keeps you aggressive while avoiding marginal opens.

  6-max dynamics to remember:
  - Standard open size is 3bb.
  - Positions: UTG, HJ, CO, BTN, SB, BB.
  - Fewer opponents allow wider ranges from late position.
