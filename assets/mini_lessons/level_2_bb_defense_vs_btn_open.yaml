      Despite being out of position, the Big Blind gets excellent pot odds.
      Call with value hands and playable suited or connected holdings that
      can realize equity postflop without committing your stack.

      Take advantage of fold equity by 3-bet shoving hands with high-card blockers
      or poor postflop playability. These shoves punish wide Button opens and
      deny them the chance to see cheap flops.
