  - title: 'Why BTN opens wide vs BB'
    content: |
      With only the blinds left to act, the Button can profitably open a wide range.
      Holding position postflop lets us pressure the Big Blind and leverage antes
      with minimal risk.
  - title: 'Fold equity and punishability from BB'
    content: |
      At 15bb effective, the Big Blind must defend carefully. Many hands cannot
      call or 3-bet shove profitably, giving our opens immediate fold equity.
      Only strong reshove or defend ranges punish overly loose opens.
