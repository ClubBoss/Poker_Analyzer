      - title: 'Why BTN opens wide vs BB'
        content: |
          With only the blinds left to act, the Button can profitably open a wide range.
          Holding position postflop lets us pressure the Big Blind and leverage antes
          with minimal risk.
      - title: 'Fold equity and punishability from BB'
        content: |
          At 15bb effective, the Big Blind must defend carefully. Many hands cannot
          call or 3-bet shove profitably, giving our opens immediate fold equity.
          Only strong reshove or defend ranges punish overly loose opens.

      - title: 'When to call vs BTN open at 15bb'
        content: |
          Despite being out of position, the Big Blind gets excellent pot odds.
          Call with value hands and playable suited or connected holdings that
          can realize equity postflop without committing your stack.
      - title: 'When to reshove'
        content: |
          Take advantage of fold equity by 3-bet shoving hands with high-card blockers
          or poor postflop playability. These shoves punish wide Button opens and
          deny them the chance to see cheap flops.
