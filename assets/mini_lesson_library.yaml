      - title: 'Why BTN opens wide vs BB'
        content: |
          With only the blinds left to act, the Button can profitably open a wide range.
          Holding position postflop lets us pressure the Big Blind and leverage antes
          with minimal risk.
      - title: 'Fold equity and punishability from BB'
        content: |
          At 15bb effective, the Big Blind must defend carefully. Many hands cannot
          call or 3-bet shove profitably, giving our opens immediate fold equity.
          Only strong reshove or defend ranges punish overly loose opens.
