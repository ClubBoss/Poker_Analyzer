      "After calling the button's flop bet, mix in turn check-raises on cards that strengthen your range and weaken theirs.",
  'UTG vs MP, Flop 3-Bet':

      "Overbetting the river can apply maximum pressure on capped ranges; choose polarized hands when deciding to use this line.",
  'BB Defense vs SB, Turn Float':
