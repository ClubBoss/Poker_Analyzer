What it is
Limp pots start when one or more players enter the pot for the minimum without raising. Your choices are isolate (raise), overlimp (call), or check in the blinds. Iso aims to play heads-up in position versus a capped range. Overlimp aims to realize equity cheaply in multiway. In the blinds, you often check and play postflop with range advantage only on some textures.

Why it matters
Limpers advertise weakness, but many still call raises. Correct iso sizes reclaim initiative, isolate the weakest opponent, and set clean SPRs. Overlimping the right hands prints in passive pools. Poor choices bloat pots OOP, invite multiway, and force tough turns where your equity realizes poorly.

Rules of thumb
- Iso basics: IP vs 1 limper raise ~5–6bb; add ~1bb per extra limper. OOP use ~7–9bb; add ~1–2bb per extra. Size up versus sticky callers or deeper stacks; size down slightly when stacks are 40–60bb to keep turn jam trees clean.
- Range shape: linear versus weak fields (broadways, pairs, suited). Add blocker bluffs (Axs/Kxs) more IP. Trim offsuit junk OOP that plays badly multiway.
- Overlimp policy: take the price with suited connectors, suited gappers, and small pairs behind passive limpers. Avoid dominated overlimps when aggressive players remain who squeeze often.
- Postflop after iso: small_cbet_33 on dry Axx/Kxx to tax floats; half_pot_50 on middling textures when value and fold equity both matter; size_up_wet only with strong equity on T98/QJT two-tone. OOP protect_check_range on middling and defend raises tighter.
- Limp-checked pots: IP stab often on boards that miss ranges. If flop checks through and a turn favors you, probe_turns. When pools overfold OOP turns, half_pot_50 with overfold_exploit. Avoid autopilot big_bet_75 without equity.
- Turn and river: delay_turn after flop checks when the card favors you; double_barrel_good on credible range-shifting turns; triple_barrel_scare only when the river scare completes your story and your blockers support it.
- Escalation path: if a frequent limper starts raising later, fold marginal overlimps and consider 3bet_oop_12bb from blinds versus late steals to avoid dominated multiway.

Mini example
HJ limps 100bb effective. CO isolates to 6bb IP. BTN and blinds fold; limper calls. Pot ~13.5bb; stacks ~94bb; SPR ~7. Flop K72r. CO small_cbet_33 ~4.5bb to tax broadways and gutters; limper calls. Pot ~22.5bb; stacks ~89.5bb. Turn 5x brings wheel gutters for CO and reduces 72/7x equity. CO chooses half_pot_50 ~11bb to deny equity and set river geometry. River bricks. With KQ/A5s value or relevant blockers, consider a thin value bet; otherwise check down.

Common mistakes
- Using open sizes as iso sizes and leaving the pot multiway. Fix: scale up to deny entries and set SPR for value hands.
- Overlimping OOP with offsuit broadways that realize poorly. Fix: fold or iso tighter; do not invite multiway without a plan.
- Calling limp-raises too wide without position or blockers. Fix: fold by default; continue only with strong value or clear plans.
- Autopilot big_bet_75 on wet flops with no equity. Fix: check or small_cbet_33; pick up aggression when turns improve you.

Mini-glossary
Iso raise: raise over one or more limpers to isolate a weak range and take initiative.
Overlimp: call behind a limper to see a flop cheaply with playable suited/connected hands.
small_cbet_33 / half_pot_50 / big_bet_75: pot-based families for flop/turn sizing.
size_up_wet / size_down_dry: directional adjustments by board texture.
probe_turns / delay_turn: take the betting lead on turns after missed c-bets.
protect_check_range: structured checks to keep medium-strength hands safe.
overfold_exploit: intentional pressure where pools fold too often in a node.
double_barrel_good / triple_barrel_scare: turn/river aggression triggers.

Contrast
Unlike standard raised pots, limp pots begin with capped ranges and higher fold equity IP. Versus blind-vs-blind steals, you target a single weak range and use tailored iso sizes to avoid multiway and awkward OOP SPRs.
