What it is
Pot odds compare the cost to continue versus the total pot you can win. Required equity = price / (pot + price). If your hand’s chance to win meets or exceeds this threshold, calling is breakeven or better. If not, folding is correct absent implied odds or bluffs to punish.

Why it matters
Every call, raise, or draw hinges on equity versus price. Pot odds prevent emotional calls and anchor your thresholds under time pressure. Mastering this math lets you convert board textures and range estimates into clear, repeatable decisions.

Rules of thumb

* Compute quickly: required equity ≈ price / (pot + price).
* Gutshots ~8–9% per street; open-enders ~16–17%; flush draws ~19–20% per street.
* Multiway demands more equity; dominated draws shrink real equity.
* Versus tiny bets, call widely; versus large bets, continue narrowly.
* Add implied odds only when future bets are likely and clean.

Mini example
Pot is 12bb. Villain bets 4bb. Price = 4. Total pot if you call = 16. Required equity = 4/16 = 25%. Your hand is a nut flush draw with two overcards that you estimate at ~35–40% to win by river when called. Calling is +EV; raising can also work if fold equity is credible.

Common mistakes

* Using pot size before the bet instead of including the call in the denominator.
* Overcrediting implied odds in capped pots or when out of position.
* Ignoring reverse implied odds when your draw is to a dominated or obvious hand.
