What it is
This module explains pot odds, equity, implied odds, reverse implied odds, the breakeven percentage, and the quick estimate called the rule of 2 and 4. Pot odds compare the price of a call to the money you can win. Equity is your chance to win at showdown if all remaining cards are dealt.

Why it matters
Pot odds turn hunches into clear math. When you know your breakeven percentage, you can call, fold, or raise without guessing. Implied odds help you include future winnings when the current price is slightly poor; reverse implied odds warn you when a made card can still lose money.

Rules of thumb
- Pot odds formula: call_amount / (pot + call_amount). This equals the breakeven percentage for a call. If your equity exceeds this number, a pure call is profitable.
- Rule of 2 and 4: on the flop multiply clean outs by 4 to estimate equity to the river; on the turn multiply by 2 for one card to come. Example: 9 clean outs ~ 36% on the flop; ~ 18% on the turn.
- Count clean outs only: remove outs that pair the board to make full houses, give an opponent a higher hand, or are blocked by visible cards. Dirty outs should not be used.
- Implied vs reverse implied odds: a slightly bad price now can be OK if you will win extra bets when you hit; but draws that often make second best need a better immediate price or position edge.
- Multiway price: extra callers enlarge the pot, improving your immediate odds, but more ranges continuing can make some outs dirtier.

Mini example
Pot is 90 after preflop. BB and MP see the flop. BB checks, MP bets 30. Action is on BB with a 9-out flush draw. Pot odds = 30 / (90 + 30) = 25%. Rule of 4 on the flop: 9 outs ~ 36%, so a call is profitable on immediate odds.

Turn is a blank. Pot is 150. MP bets 60. With one card to come, use the rule of 2: 9 outs ~ 18%. Pot odds = 60 / (150 + 60) ~ 28%. Without implied odds this is a fold. If MP has a strong value range and stacks are deep, implied odds can justify a call. If the board is paired, first discount to about 7 clean outs, which often flips the turn decision to a fold.

Common mistakes
- Counting all outs as clean. Why it is a mistake: some outs create full houses or higher flushes for the opponent. Why it happens: players memorize 9 flush outs and ignore blockers and texture.
- Misusing the rule of 2 and 4. Why it is a mistake: applying the flop multiplier on the turn double counts and inflates equity. Why it happens: habit from flop practice or rushing.
- Ignoring the price. Why it is a mistake: calling when pot odds exceed your equity burns chips. Why it happens: attachment to draws and fear of folding winners.

Mini-glossary
Pot odds: The call price as a fraction of the final pot if you call, computed as call_amount / (pot + call_amount).
Equity: Your chance to win at showdown if all remaining cards are dealt from here.
Implied odds: Extra money you expect to win on later streets when you hit.
Breakeven percentage: The minimum equity needed so that calling today does not lose in expectation.
