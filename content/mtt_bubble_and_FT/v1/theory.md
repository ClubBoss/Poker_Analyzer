What it is
Bubble play occurs when the field is near the money, and final-table (FT) play handles nine down to one. Both are dominated by ICM: chips risked can be worth far more or less than cEV. Seat order, who covers whom, and pay jumps drive your plan more than raw card equity.

Why it matters
Most tournament ROI comes from bubble and FT edges. You gain by stealing from players who fear busting and by avoiding coin flips that end your run. A clear, position-led system reduces panic and turns pressure nodes into routine profits.

Rules of thumb

* Bubble: attack the middle stacks you cover; avoid tangling with stacks that cover you. Open smaller to risk less and fold to jams when discipline says so.
* FT: watch pay jumps; tighten call-offs first. 3-bet jam more versus late opens when you block calls and cover.
* Micro stacks: do not fight them lightly when they are about to bust elsewhere; preserve $EV.
* Chip leader: punish passivity with high open frequency and pressure medium stacks. Do not punt multiway.
* Heads-up for ladders: when two others are all-in, stay out; do not create a side pot without very strong value.

Mini example
Ten left, nine paid. You are CO with 35bb, BTN 60bb, blinds 22bb/12bb. You cover both blinds and should steal wider to 2.0–2.1x. If BTN 3-bets small, prefer disciplined folds with medium hands to avoid covered spots. At FT with five left and a steep jump, BTN opens and SB (short) has 7bb. From BB with AJo you fold more versus BTN’s big c-bet lines because busting costs more than the extra chips.

Common mistakes

* Calling off versus stacks that cover you because “it is ahead of his range” in chips.
* Using pre-bubble sizing post-bubble; you should drop open sizes and widen steals when fear rises.
* Playing big pots multiway at FT without nutted ranges, inviting ICM disasters.
