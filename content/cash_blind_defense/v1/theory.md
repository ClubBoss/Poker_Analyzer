What it is
Blind defense covers decisions from the small blind (SB) and big blind (BB) facing opens and postflop bets. You act out of position most of the time. Your plan balances preflop ranges, 3-bet frequencies, and postflop defense guided by size, board, and rake.

Why it matters
Blinds lose by design. Tight, size-aware defense cuts that loss and turns good tables into profit. Overcalling dominated hands OOP burns EV through poor realization. Clear SB rules and disciplined BB continues versus small sizes protect equity and simplify play.

Rules of thumb
* SB: prefer 3-bet-or-fold versus most positions; flat more only vs late opens and multiway incentives.
* BB: defend wider versus small sizes; tighten versus large sizes and early-position opens.
* Postflop OOP: check often, continue with pairs, strong draws, and good backdoors; avoid thin floats.
* Use blockers for 3-bet bluffs (Axs, Kxs); pick value that dominates calls.
* Versus min-raises, add suited and connected hands in BB; still fold offsuit trash.

Mini example
CO opens 2.2x. SB should 3-bet or fold: strong broadways, pairs, and Axs as bluffs. BB defends wide due to price: suited connectors, broadways, many suited aces. Flop Q72r. CO bets 33%. SB check-calls mainly Qx, 77-TT, and best backdoors; many ace-highs fold. BB continues wider than SB because of better price and last action: Qx, pairs, OESDs, BDFDs. Facing 66% on 986ss, both blinds tighten to strong pairs and high-equity draws.

Common mistakes
* SB overcalling versus EP and playing three streets OOP with weak realization.
* BB overfolding to small c-bets or calling pot-sized stabs with dominated trash.
* Building mixed, incoherent lines that leave you guessing on the turn.
