What it is
Turn and river play converts your flop plan into final EV. On the turn equities shift with a single card and stack-to-pot ratio shrinks. By the river hands polarize to value or bluff. Your job is to choose sizes and frequencies that fit your range and villainâ€™s range.

Why it matters
Later streets move the most chips. Errors here are expensive. Good plans capture thin value, avoid spewing bluffs on bad runouts, and apply pressure on capped ranges. Consistent sizing logic also makes you harder to exploit and easier to study.

Rules of thumb

* Barrel more when the turn improves your range or blocks theirs; slow down on bricks.
* Use larger sizes when polarized; use small block-bets for medium hands in position.
* Check more out of position to protect your range and control pot size.
* On the river bluff with hands that block calls and do not block folds.
* Choose a line on the flop that anticipates multiple rivers, not just the next card.

Mini example
BTN bets small on T72r, BB calls. Turn A. Advantage shifts to BTN: top pairs and strong Ax improve. BTN barrels bigger with AT, sets, and bluffs like KQ with backdoors. River 2 bricks and pairs the board. BTN value-bets thin with AQ and checks back marginal Tx. Bluffs are reduced because missed KQ now blocks folds and does not block calls.

Common mistakes

* Firing second barrels at the same frequency regardless of the card.
* Using medium size with polarized value or bluffing tiny on a scare card.
* Calling river without blockers or clear bluff-catch reasons.
