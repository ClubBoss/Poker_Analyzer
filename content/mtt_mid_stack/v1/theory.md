What it is
Mid stacks (~20-40bb) dominate tournament play. You have room to raise-fold, 3-bet small, or flat speculative hands. But your postflop SPR is limited, so commitment decisions loom early. Precision in open sizes, resteals, and c-bets is crucial.

Why it matters
Most tourney hands happen here. Understanding how to apply pressure without torching stack equity separates crushers from average regs. Too tight wastes opportunities; too loose burns chips fast.

Rules of thumb
* 20-25bb: use smaller opens (2.0x), mix in shoves vs tough resteal spots.
* 25-35bb: full playbook available; 3-bet non-all-in, flat suited connectors, but respect 4-bets.
* 35-40bb: close to deep but still stack-off constrained; be careful bloating pots OOP.
* Resteal aggressively vs LP opens, especially with blockers.
* Postflop: one small and one big c-bet size covers most textures; avoid overcomplicating.

Mini example
HJ 28bb opens 2.2x, CO folds, BTN 3-bets 6.2bb. HJ can fold trash, jam strong suited broadways/medium pairs, call with suited Ax. Flop decisions often come down to commitment math: if pot is ~40% of stack, jam or fold becomes clear.

Common mistakes
* Using full deep-stack ranges; you cannot float as wide or call 3-bets light.
* Bluffing river for too much of your stack and pricing yourself in badly.
* Ignoring ICM at mid depths where pay jumps begin to matter.
