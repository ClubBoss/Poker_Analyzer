What it is
Blockers are cards you hold that reduce the number of specific combos in your opponentâ€™s range. Combo counting measures how many hand combinations remain given ranks and suits. Together they guide bluff selection, thin value bets, and bluff-catch decisions on all streets.

Why it matters
A good bluff blocks calls and does not block folds. A good call blocks bluffs and does not block value. Using blockers and combos turns vague reads into countable edges. You will choose better river bluffs, avoid value-owning yourself, and construct cleaner ranges.

Rules of thumb

* Bluff with cards that block strong value (e.g., an ace blocking top pair or nut flushes).
* Prefer hands that do not block the folds you want (avoid hearts when you want folds from missed hearts).
* Value-bet more when you block their strongest draws or two-pair; less when you unblock their calls.
* Count combos simply: offsuit has 12 combos, suited has 4, pairs have 6; suits and board cards reduce these.
* On rivers pick bluffs that block calls and unblock folds; on turns add backdoor equity to your bluff set.

Mini example
River board: Kc 9c 5d 5s 2c. You consider bluffing. Holding Ac Qh blocks nut flushes and many KxA hands, and it does not block hands like 9x or pocket eights that fold. Good bluff candidate. Holding Qc Jc is bad: it blocks the flushes you want them to have to fold and gets called more often by Kx.

Common mistakes

* Treating any blocker as a green light to bluff without checking what folds you block.
* Ignoring suits and backdoors when choosing turn bluffs.
* Calling rivers with hands that unblock value and block bluffs.
