What it is
Equity realization is how much of your theoretical hand equity actually turns into pot share by showdown. Your cards might start with 40% equity, but position, bet sizes, board runouts, and fold frequencies decide whether you realize close to 40% or much less. Realization links math to line selection.

Why it matters
You do not get paid on raw equity. Out-of-position calls with weak playability often realize poorly and burn chips despite decent starting equity. In-position hands with backdoors or nut potential can realize above average. Understanding realization upgrades your calls, slows bad chases, and improves your bet/raise choices.

Rules of thumb

* Position boosts realization; out of position drops it. Prefer IP calls, OOP folds or raises.
* Nut potential > medium strength. Hands that can make the nuts realize better than dominated pairs.
* Smaller bets increase your ability to reach rivers; giant pots punish marginal hands.
* Clean outs matter. Draws to the second-best hand realize poorly due to reverse implied odds.
* Initiative helps. When you c-bet range-favored boards, you realize more by folding out equity and setting favorable sizings.

Mini example
BTN opens, BB calls. Flop Q72r. BB holds 54s. Raw equity vs BTN c-bet range might be ~25-30% with backdoors, but OOP realization is weak. Versus a small c-bet, BB can continue some of the time due to good turn cards (3, 6, spade). Change to QJTs two-tone and 54s realizes terribly: dominated, many bad turns, and heavy pressure. Folding saves EV.

Common mistakes

* Calling OOP with hands that have poor playability and few clean turn cards.
* Chasing draws that are dominated or obvious, creating reverse implied odds.
* Ignoring how bet size and future pressure reduce your ability to realize equity.
