What it is
Texas Hold’em is a community-card poker game. Players get two private cards and use five shared board cards to make the best five-card hand. Action proceeds clockwise through betting rounds: preflop, flop, turn, river. The game uses blinds to seed the pot and enforce action.

Why it matters
Clear rules let you focus on decisions, not procedure. Knowing order of play, legal actions, hand ranking, and showdown rules prevents costly errors and timeouts. Strong fundamentals also make later strategy—ranges, odds, and exploitative lines—easier to learn and execute.

Rules of thumb

* Know the button: it marks last action postflop and moves one seat each hand.
* Only four actions exist: fold, check/call, bet/raise; a raise must meet the minimum size.
* Table stakes: you can only win what you cover on the table; no reaching into your pocket mid-hand.
* Blinds post in order: small blind, then big blind; dead blinds post only to catch up a missed blind.
* Hands rank from high card to straight flush; suits are equal; five cards decide every contest.

Mini example
Nine-handed 1/2. The dealer button sits at Seat 1. Seat 2 posts small blind 1, Seat 3 posts big blind 2. Cards are dealt. Action starts left of the big blind and continues clockwise. Player in Seat 6 raises to 6. Folds to small blind, who calls 5 more. Big blind calls 4 more. Pot is 18. Flop is dealt; action now starts with small blind and proceeds to the left.

Common mistakes

* Acting out of turn or string-betting by not declaring raise intent in one motion.
* Miscounting the pot or minimum raise because antes/previous bets were overlooked.
* Mucking the winning hand at showdown by assuming the opponent has you beat.
