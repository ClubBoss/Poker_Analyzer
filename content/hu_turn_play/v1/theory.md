What it is
Heads-up turn play is the second-barrel street where ranges narrow and leverage appears. Board texture, SPR, and position decide whether you double barrel, check back, probe, or raise. Good turn strategy turns small flop edges into decisive river setups.

Why it matters
Most pots are still alive on the turn. The card can flip range advantage, kill bluffs, or unlock new ones. Correct sizing creates fold equity or sets up clean value jams. Poor turn choices bloat pots with medium strength or miss chances to realize equity and control variance.

Rules of thumb
* Card quality first: barrel cards that improve you, weaken them, or add equity (overcards, completes for you, bricks for them). Slow down on cards that improve their range.
* Position guides aggression: in position (IP) press more turns; out of position (OOP) protect your check range and choose clearer polar bets.
* Size to plan rivers: small (25-40%) for thin value/pressure, big (60-100%) when polar and when a river jam is credible.
* Keep bluff equity: prefer overcards + backdoors, gutshots with BDFD, or key blockers that remove strong calls.
* Probe wisely: when flop checks through, lead more on cards that favor you; use smaller sizes multiway-equivalent and bigger when polar.

Mini example
SB opens, BB calls. Flop K72r, SB bets 33%, BB calls. Turn 9. This helps SB's QJ/T8 backdoors and does little for BB's Kx-heavy continues. SB barrels ~60% with Kx, sets, and best backdoors (QJ, A5s BDFD), mixing checks with middling pairs. On turn 2 (pairing board), SB often goes small or checks: BB's range retains many Kx and 7x. If flop checks through and turn is A on 954r, SB probes small OOP; IP responds by floating wider and raising polarized.

Common mistakes
* Barreling brick turns that favor the caller's range and burning equity with no blockers.
* Checking back too many turns IP and giving free rivers when you should deny equity.
* Using a single turn size for all spots, making river trees awkward or non-credible.
