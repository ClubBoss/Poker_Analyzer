What it is
Online tells are timing, sizing, and line-pattern signals that correlate with strength or weakness. Dynamics are table-wide shifts over a session: tilt waves, stack swings, and how recent showdowns change population behavior. You translate repeatable, data-like cues into small, profitable adjustments.

Why it matters
You cannot see faces online, but the client leaks rhythm. Snap-actions, long tanks, odd sizes, and auto-bet lines repeat. Correctly weighting these signals improves thin value, avoids bad hero calls, and times bluffs when pools fold too much. Dynamics amplify edges without fancy reads.

Rules of thumb

* Timing: instant checks or calls often mean auto-continue with medium strength; long tanks that end in small bets skew to value.
* Sizing: tiny probe bets (10–25%) polarize less; they skew to marginal hands or blockers. Overbets polarize hard; stations fold less, regs fold more.
* Line patterns: delayed c-bet on safe turns often equals medium value; x/r plus barrel is value-heavy in most pools.
* Session context: after showing a bluff, expect more snap-calls; after a coolered reg, expect tighter folds next orbit.
* Evidence threshold: treat a cue as “light” until seen twice; adjust one lever at a time (size or frequency), then reassess.

Mini example
You c-bet 33% on A72r. Villain snap-calls flop, long-tanks, then bets 20% on brick turn. Pattern often equals ace-x pot-control or weak pair blocker stab. You call wider, raise value thinner, and cut pure bluffs. Next hand you overbet river when you hold strong value because the same opponent just hero-called small; large polar size exploits their fold tendency to big bets.

Common mistakes

* Treating one timing event as proof and ignoring board texture or position.
* Leveling yourself into big river calls versus nits after they tank-then-raise small.
* Failing to track session shifts: pool mood changes after a huge pot, yet you keep default sizes.
