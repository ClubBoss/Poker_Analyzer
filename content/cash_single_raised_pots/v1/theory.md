What it is
Single-raised pots (SRPs) occur when one player raises preflop and one or more call, with no 3-bet. They are the bread and butter of cash games. The preflop raiser often has range advantage on high, dry boards; callers gain equity on low, connected boards.

Why it matters
SRPs are frequent and rake-sensitive. Good SRP play builds value, denies equity, and avoids thin, raked-out bluffs. Your c-bet frequencies and sizes should reflect board texture, position, and whether the pot is likely under or over the rake cap.

Rules of thumb

* Small c-bet on dry, high-card boards as the raiser; check more and size up on wet boards.
* Out of position as caller, defend pairs, strong draws, and good backdoors versus small bets; fold more to big.
* In position, float more with backdoors; raise mainly with strong value and high-equity bluffs.
* Multiway = tighter bluffs, stronger value, and simpler sizes.
* Aim lines that reach the cap with value; skip marginal stabs in tiny pots.

Mini example
CO opens, BB calls. Flop A72r. CO holds range and nut advantage. A 25-33% c-bet prints: value with Ax, protection with 77-TT, and bluffs like KQs with backdoors. Change the board to 976ss. BB now has more two-pair and strong draws. CO checks more, bets bigger when betting, and picks bluffs with backdoor equity. Versus a 66% bet as BB, continue with pairs, strong draws, and best backdoors; fold weak backdoors.

Common mistakes

* Autoc-betting 100% on boards that favor the caller.
* Bluffing with no backdoors when better candidates exist.
* Calling large sizes OOP with hands that realize poorly and get squeezed by rake.
