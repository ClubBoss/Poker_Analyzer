What it is
An isolation raise ("iso") is a raise over one or more limpers to play heads-up against the weakest opponent. Iso strategy covers hand selection, sizing by position and number of limpers, and plans for common overcalls from blinds or late position.

Why it matters
Limpers reveal weakness or a desire to see flops cheaply. Iso raises capture dead money, deny equity, and pull the hand toward positions where you have control. Without an iso plan you accept multiway, rake-heavy pots that cap your edge.

Rules of thumb
* Size up: IP use ~4x + 1x per limper; OOP use ~5-6x + 1x per limper to thin the field.
* Choose hands with playability: broadways, suited aces, suited connectors; avoid weak offsuit trash OOP.
* Target limpers who fold often or call dominated; value-bet wider versus callers, bluff less versus stickies.
* Have a plan for overcalls: c-bet small on dry boards, check more on wet, and avoid thin bluffs multiway.
* Reset when stacks are shallow: prefer value-heavy isos; reduce speculative hands.

Mini example
Two limpers in MP, you are CO 100bb deep. Iso to 7.5-8x with AJs, KQs, 99, and some suited connectors. BTN folds, blinds call sometimes. Flop T72r. As raiser IP you can c-bet small with value and backdoor bluffs. If both blinds overcall often, trim weakest iso bluffs preflop and favor hands that dominate limpers (AJo+, KQo, strong suited aces). On 986ss, check more and size up when betting.

Common mistakes
* Using min-raises that invite multiway pots and erase your initiative.
* Iso'ing junk OOP against sticky stations, creating bloated, dominated postflop spots.
* Failing to adjust sizes when a third player overcalls frequently.
