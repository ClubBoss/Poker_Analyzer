What it is
Deep stacks (40bb+) bring full-street poker into play. Open ranges widen, speculative hands rise in value, and postflop skill edges shine. Commitment is lower, so you can triple barrel, set mine, and maneuver.

Why it matters
Most edges in poker come from postflop play. With deep stacks you can leverage position, balance, and creative lines. Bad players torch chips by overplaying one pair or failing to realize equity.

Rules of thumb
* 40-60bb: similar to cash; more opens, more flats, deeper 3-bets.
* 60-100bb: speculative hands thrive; implied odds rise.
* 100bb+: full cash playbook, but watch payout phases—don’t torch in ICM spots.
* Favor position heavily; widen BTN/SB steals.
* Size opens slightly bigger to discourage multiway chaos, especially live.

Mini example
CO 80bb opens 2.5x, BTN calls, blinds fold. Flop J98ss. CO can c-bet larger to deny equity, but pot control matters when SPR high. BTN has implied odds to peel suited connectors. Deeper stacks reward patience: win big pots with nutted hands, avoid stack-offs with one pair.

Common mistakes
* Porting shallow-stack jam logic into deep play.
* Calling down too light vs big bets at high SPR.
* Ignoring tournament context (bubble/FT) where deep stacks still face ICM.
