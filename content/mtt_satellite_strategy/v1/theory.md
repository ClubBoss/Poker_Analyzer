What it is
Satellite strategy aims at winning a seat, not all the chips. Payouts are flat: every surviving stack above the bubble receives the same prize. Because extra chips above the seat threshold have little value, survival and risk control dominate over thin chip-EV gambles.

Why it matters
ICM pressure is extreme in satellites. A single marginal call-off can burn an entire buy-in of $EV even if it is slightly +cEV. Correct satellite play converts discipline into seats: attack when short and fold when safe. You exploit the field’s habit of chasing chip leads after the seat is already locked.

Rules of thumb
* Play two gears: build when far from the bubble and short; preserve when stack comfortably clears the projected seat line.
* Calls tighten first. Prefer shoves that create fold equity over thin call-offs that risk elimination.
* Coverage matters. Do not tangle with stacks that cover you when near the bubble; pressure players you cover.
* Open smaller to risk less; avoid multiway pots. Switch to raise/fold with strong blockers and to shove with hands that suffer from 3-bets.
* Track the “seat line”: average stack required to coast into a seat = total chips / seats. If you are 1.2–1.5x above it, shift to fold-first.
* Bubble time: pass small edges that risk your tournament life; fold even medium-strength hands to all-ins that cover you.

Mini example
50 players remain, 30 seats. Total chips equal 50 buy-ins, so the seat line is ~1.67 starting stacks. You hold 2.2 stacks. UTG (covers you) jams 20bb. You have AJo in HJ. In a regular MTT this can be a call or 3-bet; here you fold. Same event, you drop to 0.9 stacks with eight away from seats. Now widen shoves with blockers (Axs, KQo, 55–77) over late opens to regain safety.

Common mistakes
* Treating satellites like standard MTTs and calling off “close” because the hand is ahead of a range in chips.
* Playing big pots versus stacks that cover you when you are already safe.
* Ignoring the seat line and oscillating between reckless jams when short and unnecessary battles when deep.
