What it is
Mental game is the toolkit that keeps your decision quality stable under stress. It includes routines (warmup and cooldown), tilt triggers and responses, focus habits, simple breathing, and rules that decide when to pause or quit. The goal is consistent A-game, not constant wins.

Why it matters
Tilt costs more EV than most technical leaks. After a bad beat or long card-dead stretch, emotion narrows attention, speeds bets, and breaks ranges. A light, repeatable process makes performance robust: you play fewer hands on autopilot and recover faster after setbacks.

Rules of thumb

* Run a 3 to 5 minute warmup: goal for the session, one leak to watch, and two focus cues.
* Use a 90 second reset: sit out, breathe 4-4-4-4, label the trigger, review next-hand checklist.
* Set a mental stop-loss: if you hit two triggers in 30 minutes or feel rushed, pause or quit.
* Keep an A/B/C map: A-game lines you take; B-game shortcuts you allow; C-game signs that require a break.
* Cooldown in 2 minutes: write one hand, one emotion, one plan for next time; then close the client.

Mini example
You lose AA vs 76s all-in. Trigger detected: anger and urge to win it back. You sit out one orbit, do 6 rounds of box breathing, and say the cue line: play the hand, not the past. You reopen your A/B/C map, mark C-game if still angry, and set a 30 minute cap. If calm returns, you resume with tighter opens and clear sizing plans.

Common mistakes

* Continuing to play while narrating bad luck, which keeps you anchored to the past hand.
* Chasing losses with bigger pots or looser calls to fix mood instead of making EV.
* Adding complex meditation tasks that you cannot do in a live or online seat.
