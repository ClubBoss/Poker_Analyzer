What it is
Flop play is your first postflop decision after seeing three community cards. It connects preflop plans with later streets by choosing between bet, check, call, or raise. Good flop play weighs range advantage, nut advantage, position, equity, and future cards.

Why it matters
Most pots end on the flop. Small accuracy gains here drive your overall win rate. Correct sizing denies equity to weak draws, extracts value from worse hands, and sets up profitable turn and river lines. Weak flop habits snowball into costly later-street mistakes.

Rules of thumb

* Prefer small bets on dry, high-card boards where the preflop raiser has range advantage.
* Use bigger bets when you are polarized or when the board is wet and protection matters.
* In position you can bet thinner; out of position keep checks and raises tighter.
* Choose hands to bet for at least one of: value, protection, or bluff with backdoors.
* When unsure on neutral boards, simplify with a low-frequency small c-bet or a solid check.

Mini example
BTN opens, BB calls. Flop K72r. BTN has range and nut advantage. Small bet (~25â€“33% pot) prints value with Kx, denies equity to random overcards, and bluffs with A5s, QJs, and backdoor draws. Change the board to 986ss and BTN loses advantage; BB has more two-pair and strong draws. BTN now checks more, bets bigger when betting, and prefers backdoor-heavy bluffs.

Common mistakes

* Autoc-betting 100% on boards favoring the caller (low, connected, two-tone).
* Choosing big size with merged hands that want calls from worse.
* Bluffing with zero backdoors when better candidates exist.
