What it is
Short-handed cash means fewer seats than full-ring, commonly 6-max, 4-max, or heads-up. With fewer players, blinds hit more often, ranges widen, and aggression rises. You will face more blind battles, more 3-bets, and more decisions in position.

Why it matters
Edges are amplified because you play more hands per hour and your positional skill repeats more often. In tight or cautious pools, you can steal relentlessly. In wild pools, you earn by value-betting bigger and calling down correctly. Short-handed rewards clean fundamentals: position, sizing, and range awareness.

Rules of thumb

* Open wider by seat: UTG in 6-max is closer to MP in full-ring; the button is a license to print if blinds overfold.
* 3-bet more from blinds and the button, but keep value at the core; use Axs and Kxs as blocker bluffs.
* C-bet small on dry high-card boards; size up on wet/low boards that favor the caller.
* Blind vs blind play is frequent: defend BB wider vs small opens; SB prefers 3-bet-or-fold vs many players.
* Keep bet sizes consistent: one small and one big size per node is enough for clarity under fire.

Mini example
Four-handed. CO opens 2.2x, BTN calls, blinds fold. Flop K72r. CO has range and nut advantage. Small c-bet (~25-33%) with Kx, QQ-TT, and backdoor bluffs like A5s works well. Change to 986ss and the caller improves; CO now checks more, bets bigger with sets/strong draws, and trims air. In blind vs blind, SB opens 2.5x, BB defends wide; on A83r the SB can range-bet small, while on T97ss the SB checks more and polarizes.

Common mistakes

* Porting full-ring ranges to 6-max and folding too much, especially on the button and in the BB.
* Flatting too many offsuit Broadways out of position that realize equity poorly.
* Using many sizes without purpose, which creates leaks and study bloat.
