What it is
GTO (game theory optimal) aims for strategies that cannot be exploited by perfect opponents. Exploitative play aims to maximize EV against real opponents by deviating from GTO when they make consistent mistakes. Practical poker blends both: a stable baseline plus targeted exploits.

Why it matters
You need a default that holds up under pressure and a method to capitalize on leaks. Pure GTO can leave chips on the table versus weak fields. Pure exploit can be punished by sharp opponents. A controlled mix gives you resilience and upside while keeping study and in-game execution manageable.

Rules of thumb

* Start from a simple baseline: tight opens early, wider late; small bets on dry boards, big on wet.
* Exploit obvious leaks hard: overfolders get bluffed more; calling stations get value-bet bigger.
* Track evidence. Exploits need repeatable patterns, not one-off hands.
* Protect yourself. When unsure or against strong players, revert toward baseline.
* Adjust only a few dials at once: frequency, size, or combo choice; keep ranges coherent.

Mini example
Population in your pool overfolds to flop c-bets on A-high dry boards. Baseline might c-bet ~60% small. You exploit by c-betting ~80-90% small with any equity and many airs. Versus a reg who punishes this with raises, you revert to baseline, cut air, and keep value. On later streets, value-bet thinner versus the calling station but tighten bluffs versus the same player.

Common mistakes

* Switching to wild exploits without proof and torching EV when the read is wrong.
* Over-adjusting in every node, breaking range consistency and losing track mid-hand.
* Refusing to exploit obvious leaks and defaulting to rigid lines that cap profit.
