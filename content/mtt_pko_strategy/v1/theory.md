What it is
PKO (progressive knockout) tournaments award cash for busting players. Each bounty is split: you earn half now and the other half adds to your own bounty. Strategy blends standard MTT play with bounty EV. Covering a player makes their bounty “live” for you; being covered makes you a target.

Why it matters
Bounties change thresholds. Hands that are marginal chip-EV calls can become +EV when a covered opponent is all-in for a large bounty. Conversely, multiway all-ins where you do not cover anyone can be traps. Learning to price bounties and shape pots heads-up around them increases ROI sharply.

Rules of thumb

* Prioritize coverage: call wider when you cover the all-in player and his bounty is big; fold tighter when you do not.
* Heads-up > multiway for bounty capture; isolate with larger raises when a short, big-bounty stack jams.
* Early stages: bounties are smaller versus stack depth; still prefer value and clean equity. Late stages: big bounties justify wider punishes.
* Convert bounty to chips by anchoring to the buy-in: as a rough rule, treat a starting-bounty as ~0.5 buy-in; scale by what remains on villain and field depth.
* Avoid dominated calls versus players who cover you; you donate your own bounty when you bust.

Mini example
Blinds 1k/2k/2k. Villain (8bb) jams from CO with a large bounty; you are BTN with A9s and 40bb. You cover him. Even if A9s is a borderline chip-EV call, the bounty makes it profitable, especially if blinds are tight. You raise to isolate if blinds overcall too much. Different case: same jam, but you are SB with 12bb and BB covers you. Calling off light risks your whole stack and your bounty; fold more.

Common mistakes

* Treating PKO like a normal MTT and passing on profitable bounty calls when you cover.
* Chasing bounties in multiway pots that crush your equity share; isolate instead.
* Calling off wide versus cover stacks because “there is a bounty,” donating your own bounty too often.
