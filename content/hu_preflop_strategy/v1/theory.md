What it is
Heads-up preflop covers play with only two players. The small blind (SB) is also the button and acts first preflop, last on later streets. Ranges widen sharply, limping becomes viable, and 3-bets occur at higher frequencies. Stack depth and opponent tendencies drive mix between raise, limp, call, and 3-bet.

Why it matters
You will face more orbits and more blind battles than in any other format. Small preflop edges repeat dozens of times per hour and compound. A simple, robust SB opening plan and a disciplined BB defense create steady EV while keeping decisions quick on mobile.

Rules of thumb
* SB opens: mix 2.0–2.5x raises with strategic limps. Raise most suited aces, broadways, and high playability hands; limp more middling offsuit and trap some strong hands to protect the limp range.
* BB vs raise: defend wide versus small sizes; 3-bet blocker-heavy hands (Axs, Kxs, Q5s+) and value (broadways, pairs). Versus 2x you defend very wide; versus 3x you tighten.
* BB vs limp: attack with 3–4x raises at sensible frequency. Isolate with value and suited connectors; check back weakest trash to realize equity.
* 3-bet sizing: IP 3-bet to ~3.5–4x; OOP to ~4–5x. Jam more when short (<=25bb) with pairs, strong aces, and suited broadways; call more deep.
* Adjust by opponent: overfolders get peppered with raises; sticky callers get value-heavy opens and larger iso sizes; 4-bet-happy opponents demand tighter opens and more 5-bet jams with blockers.

Mini example
100bb effective. SB raises 2.2x. BB defends Q8s profitably or 3-bets some frequency. Versus a 3x, BB folds more offsuit trash but keeps suited gappers. Same match at 20bb: SB trims limps and raises more jam-friendly hands; BB 3-bet jams A5s, 66–99, and calls less. Against a limp from SB, BB raises 3.5–4x with KTo, Q9s, and 76s, checking behind 83o.

Common mistakes
* SB opening too large by default, making BB’s defense and 3-bets too profitable.
* BB overfolding versus 2x opens or failing to attack frequent SB limps.
* Building overly complex mixed strategies that you cannot execute quickly in real time.
