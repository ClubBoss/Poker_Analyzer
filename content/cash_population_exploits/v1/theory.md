What it is
Population exploits are adjustments you make against the typical habits of your pool, not a single opponent. They rely on patterns that hold across many hands: overfolding to small c-bets, under-defending vs 3-bets, tiny river bluffs, or value sizing tells. You collect evidence, adjust one lever, and measure results.

Why it matters
Pure GTO leaves EV on the table against weak or predictable fields. Pure guesswork is fragile. Population exploits aim between: a simple baseline plus targeted, data-backed tweaks. You will win more with fewer mental branches by focusing on the three or four biggest leaks you see often.

Rules of thumb

* Track evidence. Use short notes like: “Pool overfolds to 1/3 on A-high,” “SB flats too wide,” “Turn raises are value-heavy.”
* Adjust one lever at a time: frequency, size, or combo choice. Keep ranges coherent.
* Overfolders: bluff more small and value-bet thinner; underfolders: bluff less and go bigger for value.
* Under-3-bettors: open wider; over-3-bettors: tighten opens, 4-bet bluff with blockers.
* River honesty: if population is underbluffing big rivers, fold bluff-catchers; value bet thinner small.

Mini example
Your database shows pool folds 55% to 1/3-pot c-bets on Axx dry boards. Baseline might c-bet ~60% small; exploit to ~85-90% with any equity and some air. Same pool massively underbluffs big rivers: facing 80-100% pot, you fold more bluff-catchers and value-bet bigger when checked to. Against one reg who fights back with raises, revert to baseline.

Common mistakes

* Building exploits on small samples or memorable hands; you need repeat signals.
* Changing too many knobs at once and losing track mid-hand.
* Ignoring table mix; what prints at 1/2 live may fail at 500NL reg tables.
