What it is
Bankroll management (BRM) is a set of rules that tie your game size to the money reserved for poker. It covers buy-in counts, shot taking, stop-loss and move-down triggers, and how you separate poker funds from living money. BRM lets variance be noise instead of a threat.

Why it matters
Good players bust when variance meets poor BRM. You cannot realize skill if one bad week ends your roll. A clear plan absorbs downswings, reduces tilt, and lets you climb stakes on schedule. Solid BRM also clarifies when to quit a session and which games to avoid.

Rules of thumb

* Cash games: keep 20 to 40 full buy-ins for your main stake; use the higher end if the pool is tough or swingy.
* Tournaments: keep 100 to 300 average buy-ins; variance is larger and edges are thinner.
* Risk per table: do not risk more than 2 to 5 percent of your roll at a time; cap daily loss at 5 to 10 percent.
* Move down when your roll falls below the floor (for example, under 20 buy-ins for cash); take shots only above a ceiling with a pre-set stop-loss.
* Keep a separate account for poker; track results weekly; withdraw on a schedule, not based on mood.

Mini example
You have 2000 USD and want to play 1/2 live (200 USD buy-in). That is only 10 buy-ins, too thin. Good BRM picks 0.5/1 (100 USD buy-in) with 20 buy-ins and sets a daily stop-loss of 200 to 300 USD. After growing to 3000 USD, you take a 1/2 shot with one buy-in and a hard rule: if the shot fails, return to 0.5/1 until back above 3000 USD.

Common mistakes

* Mixing life money and poker money, then chasing losses to avoid withdrawing.
* Moving up after a heater without a plan, then refusing to move down when the floor is hit.
* Ignoring rake and game quality; high rake or tough pools need deeper BRM.
