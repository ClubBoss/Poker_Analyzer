What it is
This module explains bankroll management: how many buy-ins to keep for your games, how to handle downswings, and how to pick tables that fit your roll. You will learn rules for moving up and down, smart shot-taking, session stop-losses, and simple record-keeping to keep decisions clear.

Why it matters
Skill does not protect you from variance. A sound bankroll plan reduces risk of ruin and keeps you steady when cards run cold. Good game selection plus disciplined move-up and move-down rules let you survive bad runs and capitalize when you have an edge, instead of bouncing between stakes on tilt.

Rules of thumb
- Cash games online: keep 40-50 full buy-ins; live cash can use 20-30 because hands per hour and some rake structures reduce variance. Add buy-ins if games are short-handed or you play high-variance lines.
- Tournaments: keep 100-200 average buy-ins; turbo or large-field events may need 300+ because top-heavy payouts and long bubbles increase variance.
- Shot-taking: move up only when you hold at least 5-10 extra buy-ins for the higher stake; end the shot immediately if you lose 2-3 buy-ins and return to your prior level.
- Stop-loss: cap a session at 2-4 buy-ins to protect decision quality; review notes and continue later, not while tilted.
- Game selection first: prefer soft tables with deep stacks and loose callers; avoid tough lineups, high rake, and formats that outpace your roll even if the seat is convenient.

Mini example
Bankroll = 50 buy-ins for NL25 online cash. You play a new session: UTG opens, CO calls, BTN and SB fold, BB calls. Flop checks to UTG, who c-bets; two folds and UTG wins. Despite this pot, the session sits at -3 buy-ins from earlier hands. Per your plan, you hit the stop-loss, leave, log hands and notes, and schedule the next session at NL16 until the bankroll returns to 50+ buy-ins for NL25 again.

Common mistakes
- Playing under-rolled. Why it is a mistake: a normal downswing can bust the roll before skill shows. Why it happens: impatience to climb stakes or to chase prior highs.
- Refusing to move down. Why it is a mistake: you bleed confidence and cash at a level you cannot sustain today. Why it happens: ego and status concerns overshadow math.
- Ignoring game selection. Why it is a mistake: tough tables increase variance and reduce win rate. Why it happens: convenience or fear of changing seats.

Mini-glossary
Bankroll: The poker-only money set aside to absorb variance and fund future sessions.
Buy-in: The amount needed to sit in a game; bankroll rules are expressed as multiples of this.
Risk of ruin: The chance your bankroll hits zero given win rate and variance; more buy-ins reduce this risk.
Shot-take: A temporary move up to test a higher stake with strict loss limits and a preplanned retreat.
Stop-loss: A predefined maximum session loss that ends play and protects bankroll and decisions.

Contrast
Unlike core_gto_vs_exploit, which tweaks strategy based on opponent leaks, this module focuses on financial safeguards, seat and stake selection, and disciplined session rules so you stay in action long enough for skill to matter.
