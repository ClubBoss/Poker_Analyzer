What it is
Short stacks in tournaments (under ~20 big blinds) force binary decisions: shove, fold, or occasionally induce. You have no room to maneuver postflop, so preflop math and ICM are king. Knowing jam/fold thresholds by position and stack depth is the skill.

Why it matters
Small stack spots repeat constantly in tournaments. Maximizing fold equity, surviving bubbles, and laddering up require precise shoves and disciplined folds. Errors are magnified: one bad jam can end your run, one missed shove can waste your last chance to accumulate.

Rules of thumb
* Under 10bb: mostly jam or fold; use charts by position.
* 10-15bb: add a few min-raises with monsters or traps; still lean shove-heavy.
* 15-20bb: opens and 3-bets appear, but jams are still common vs resteal stacks.
* Consider payout stage: tighter on bubbles, wider when covering short stacks.
* Offsuit junk is rarely playable; suited connectors/gappers gain value when fold equity is high.

Mini example
10bb in HJ, folds to you. Jam A7s: good blocker, live cards, strong fold equity. Fold K4o: too weak, dominated when called. Same stack BTN vs blinds: jam much widerâ€”any ace, broadways, many suited kings. At FT bubble with pay jumps, trim range back even if chip EV suggests jamming wider.

Common mistakes
* Limping at short stacks instead of shoving.
* Calling off too wide versus shoves; need stronger ranges due to lack of fold equity.
* Ignoring ICM and busting marginally when pay jumps are huge.
