What it is
Antes are forced contributions that join the blinds in tournament pots, often as a single big blind ante (BBA). Phases: pre-ante (tight opens), ante phase (pots start larger, ranges widen), and late phase (short stacks, ICM pressure). Antes boost pot odds and reward aggression.

Why it matters
With antes, folding costs more each orbit and steals pay better. You must widen steals, defend blinds more versus small sizes, and pick shove/fold thresholds that reflect extra dead money. Mistakes compound fast: too tight wastes EV, too loose burns chips when stacks are shallow.

Rules of thumb

* Pre-ante: standard opens ~2.2-2.5x; tighter ranges, fewer multiway pots.
* Ante on: cut open size slightly (2.0-2.3x), increase frequency at late positions, and 3-bet bluff a bit more with blockers.
* BBA improves BB price; defend wider vs small opens and c-bets, but still fold offsuit trash to big sizes.
* Short stacks: prefer shove over raise/call; add a pip of aggression due to antes but respect ICM near bubbles.
* Postflop: smaller c-bets print more often since ranges are wider and pot is bigger; size up on wet boards and at low SPR.

Mini example
30bb effective with BBA. CO opens 2.1x, BTN folds, SB folds, BB defends wider due to price. Flop A72r, CO bets 1/3. BB continues with Ax, pairs, and good backdoors. Turn 9 completes little; CO barrels bigger with value and best bluffs. If stacks drop to 15bb, CO cuts open frequency, adds jam-or-fold versus 3-bets, and trims speculative hands. Near the bubble, CO tightens, while BTN steals more when payouts loom.

Common mistakes

* Keeping pre-ante open sizes and frequencies after antes begin.
* Over-defending low playability hands from BB versus big sizes because “pot odds are good.”
* Ignoring ICM in late phases and jamming marginal spots that torch payout equity.
