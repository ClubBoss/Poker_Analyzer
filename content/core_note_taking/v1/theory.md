What it is
This module builds a fast note-taking and review system for poker. You will capture key info in seconds during play and route hands into a simple study loop after the session. The aim is short, structured notes that improve decisions without stealing focus.

Why it matters
Accurate notes compound edge. They reveal pool leaks, player habits, and your own recurring mistakes. A lightweight system keeps you present at the table while ensuring high-value hands and reads are not lost. Good notes also cut study time by pointing directly at repeatable patterns.

Rules of thumb
- Keep notes atomic. One idea per line: action, texture, size, and result; short tags beat paragraphs because they are searchable and fast. Why: atomic lines can be scanned and filtered later without re-reading prose.
- Tag players with stable traits. Examples: overfold_flop, calls_down, tiny_3bet; stable tags pay off across sessions. Why: persistent labels transfer between tables and months.
- Capture first, analyze later. In-session write the minimum; do deep review when the clock is off so you do not miss live decisions. Why: analysis mode and play mode conflict and slow you down.
- Record positions and sizes. UTG vs BB differs from CO vs BTN; include seats and size family (small, medium, large). Why: ranges and incentives depend on position and price.
- Route every note. Send hands to fix_now, study_spot, or player_read; this prevents backlog creep. Why: routing converts raw notes into next actions.

Mini example
UTG opens, CO calls, BTN folds, SB folds, BB calls.
Flop K72 rainbow: BB checks, UTG bets small, CO calls, BB folds.
Quick capture for CO: "CO vs UTG srp, K72r, call small, turn 5, fold to second barrel."
After session add player tag: "folds_turn_vs_double_small," then route hand to study_spot: "flop defense vs early range."

Common mistakes
- Writing essays mid-session. Why it is a mistake: you miss new action and tilt from rehashing; Why it happens: desire to explain the whole hand while emotions run high.
- Vague labels. Why it is a mistake: "spewy" or "weird" cannot be searched or applied; Why it happens: rushing without a tag list or examples.
- No routing. Why it is a mistake: notes pile up and never change behavior; Why it happens: no default buckets, so review feels overwhelming.

Mini-glossary
Tag: A short, searchable label like overfold_flop that captures a repeatable behavior.
One-line review: A single sentence that records the key lesson from a hand.
Route to study: A rule that sends each captured hand to fix_now, study_spot, or player_read.
Pool read: A note about a general pool trend, such as overfold_vs_big_turn.

Contrast
Unlike core_mental_game, which centers on routines and tilt control, this module creates a capture-and-review pipeline so your play and study inform each other.
