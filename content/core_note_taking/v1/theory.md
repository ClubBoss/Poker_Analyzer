What it is
Note taking is a compact way to capture opponent behavior you can act on later. Good notes record observable facts: positions, sizes, timing, and showdowns. They avoid stories and keep to short, tagged lines that are easy to scan on a phone during play.

Why it matters
Reads compound. Clear notes let you exploit repeat patterns, recall lines between sessions, and share a language with study partners. You also reduce bias by writing what happened, not what you felt. Over weeks the notebook becomes a private database of pool tendencies.

Rules of thumb

* Write facts, not feelings: include seat, action, size, board, and showdown if seen.
* Use short tags and codes: OOP, IP, 3b, x/r, 1/3, 2/3, donk, stab, overbet, tank.
* Prioritize repeat spots: raises vs c-bet, donk frequencies, limp habits, river size tells.
* Timestamp and context: cash or MTT, stack depth, heads-up or multiway.
* Review weekly and convert fuzzy notes into clear exploits you can apply.

Mini example
BTN vs BB, 100bb. Board A72r. Villain c/c 1/3, turn 9, c/c 1/2, river 2, c/f to 3/4. Tag: overfolds river after two calls on A-high. Second hand: CO opens 2.5x, same villain 3-bets small from SB, shows A5s at showdown. Tag: SB small 3-bets wide vs CO. Both notes are short, factual, and ready to use.

Common mistakes

* Writing paragraphs you cannot parse mid-session; long text hides the key exploit.
* Recording one-offs as law; apply a light confidence tag until you see repeats.
* Omitting sizes and positions, which makes the note hard to use later.
