What it is
This module explains table positions (UTG, MP, CO, BTN, SB, BB) and the idea of initiative. Positions determine acting order on each street. Initiative is the practical label for the player who made the last aggressive action on the prior street and who often gets checked to by default. You also learn how position categories map to early, middle, and late seats, and how these labels frame decisions in both heads-up and multiway pots.

Why it matters
Position controls information. The player who acts last sees more decisions before committing chips, which improves decision quality and EV. Initiative creates clear default lines such as check_to_raiser, speeding play and reducing confusion, yet it can change when the situation changes. Mastering both concepts reduces spew, clarifies planning, and increases your edge in common spots.

Rules of thumb
- Early vs late: UTG and MP are early_position; CO and BTN are late_position; late positions act after most players, which is an advantage.
- In position: if you will act after your opponent on the current street, you are in_position; more info means fewer mistakes.
- Default flow: after a preflop open, out-of-position defenders often check_to_raiser; the preflop aggressor then decides whether to continue.
- Initiative is not a rule: it is a guideline that shifts whenever a player leads into the aggressor or raises; always update who is the current aggressor.
- Multiway caution: with 3+ players, initiative and acting order interact; being last to act matters more because multiple checks and bets may occur.

Mini example
UTG opens and BB calls. Flop: BB checks to the preflop raiser (check_to_raiser). UTG bets, BB calls. Turn: action again starts with BB. BB checks, UTG checks back. River: BB bets and UTG folds. Initiative began with UTG preflop, UTG retained it on the flop when betting, but the river lead by BB shifted practical control of the final decision to UTG, who acted last.

Common mistakes
- Treating initiative as a law; mistake because it is only a default. Players over-cbet in bad textures since they assume they must bet because they were the opener.
- Ignoring position; mistake because acting first is harder. Players chase hands from out_of_position and guess more often.
- Mis-reading multiway spots; mistake because initiative and last-to-act diverge. Players bet without realizing a late-position caller still acts behind.

Mini-glossary
- Initiative: the player who made the last aggressive action on the prior street, often checked to by default.
- In_position: you act after your opponent on the current street.
- Out_of_position: you act before your opponent on the current street.
- Check_to_raiser: a common default where defenders check to the prior street's aggressor.

Contrast line
This module optimizes where and when you act and who drives the action; the adjacent module "core_rules_and_setup" covers procedural legality and turn order, not strategy.
