What it is
This module defines 6-max positions - UTG, MP, CO, BTN, SB, BB - and opening ranges by seat. It also explains initiative vs no-initiative. The player who was the last aggressor on the previous street has initiative; the caller has no-initiative.

Why it matters
Position gives more information and cheaper, clearer decisions. Playing more hands when you act later helps you realize equity and control pot size. Initiative lets you win uncontested pots and value bet more cleanly because your prior aggression credibly represents strong hands.

Rules of thumb
- UTG and MP open tight. Many players remain to act, so dominated hands get punished by calls and 3-bets.
- CO opens wider. Only BTN and blinds remain, so more playable hands turn a profit through steals and position.
- BTN opens widest. You act last postflop most often, realize equity well, and can bluff more profitably.
- SB: prefer raise-or-fold. Completing invites tough out-of-position trees; if you open small (typical online), have a plan vs 3-bets.
- BB defends wider vs small opens and tightens vs large opens common live. You close action and get a price, but big sizes cut your pot odds.
- Initiative rule. The last aggressor keeps initiative on the next street; the caller has no-initiative and usually checks to the aggressor.

Mini example
UTG opens to 2.3 bb (typical online). MP folds, CO calls, BTN folds, SB folds, BB calls. Flop: BB checks first as the out-of-position player. UTG has initiative from the preflop raise and makes a small continuation bet. CO folds, BB calls. Turn: BB checks again; UTG checks back to control pot with a medium-strength hand. River checks through; no river bet means first_active_left_of_btn_shows. Key points: UTG set the tone with initiative, while CO as the caller had no-initiative and fewer profitable bluff lines.

Common mistakes
- Opening too loose from UTG or MP. Why it is a mistake: you face more 3-bets and play dominated hands out of position. Why it happens: players copy BTN charts everywhere.
- Ignoring position postflop. Why it is a mistake: building big pots out of position with medium-strength hands loses control. Why it happens: focus on own cards, not seat and order.
- Habitual limping in SB. Why it is a mistake: you invite BB to realize equity and attack. Why it happens: fear of raising and facing a 3-bet.

Mini-glossary
Position names: UTG, MP, CO, BTN, SB, BB in 6-max order from earliest to latest preflop action.
Initiative: The right to represent strength because you were the last aggressor on the previous street.
No-initiative: You called on the prior street and usually check first, representing a narrower bluff set.
Open size: Your first-raise amount preflop; 2.0-2.5 bb is common in 6-max (typical online).

Contrast
Unlike core_rules_and_setup, which covers mechanics and definitions, this module shows how seat and initiative vs no-initiative guide default openings and postflop plans.
