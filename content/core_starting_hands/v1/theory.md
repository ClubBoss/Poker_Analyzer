What it is
Starting hands are the two cards you are dealt preflop. A range is the set of hands you play from a seat given action in front of you. Position, stack depth, and table tendencies determine how many hands you open, call, or 3-bet.

Why it matters
Good preflop discipline simplifies the rest of the hand. Tight, position-aware ranges avoid dominated spots and let you value-bet more often. Cleaner ranges also create clearer postflop plans and maximize EV against common population leaks.

Rules of thumb

* Play tighter early; widen on the button and in the blinds versus passive fields.
* Favor high card strength and connectivity; offsuit trash loses most equity realization.
* Open-raise to isolate; cold-calling is selective and position-dependent.
* 3-bet your best hands and some suited/connected bluffs; avoid flatting dominated offsuit Broadways.
* Fold the bottom quickly; save chips for profitable spots.

Mini example
Nine-handed. UTG opens a disciplined range: pairs 77+, AJs+, KQs, AQo+. MP tightens slightly; CO adds suited connectors and suited Axs. Button opens widest: many suited aces, suited connectors, and more offsuit Broadways. In the small blind, prefer 3-bet or fold; in the big blind, defend more versus small sizes but drop offsuit trash versus large opens.

Common mistakes

* Copying charts blindly without adjusting for table looseness or raise sizing.
* Overcalling dominated hands out of position that realize equity poorly.
* Ignoring blockers and card removal when selecting 3-bet bluffs.
