What it is
Cash game rake is the fee the house takes from pots. Stakes define blind sizes and typical buy-ins. Rake structure (percent, cap, and method) directly changes breakeven thresholds, viable styles, and which games are beatable.

Why it matters
Small edges vanish in high-rake games. A board that is a routine call in theory can be -EV after rake. Choosing stakes with kinder rake caps and good lineups can swing your hourly more than any single tactic. You want a game where your style clears the rake tax.

Rules of thumb

* Lower stakes often have higher relative rake. Beat them by playing tighter, value-heavy poker.
* Prefer tables with a cap reached often. Once capped, later streets are "rake free."
* Avoid tiny multiway pots. Raise more hands or fold; limping leaks rake.
* Size opens to build pots that reach the cap with value; do not bloat junk.
* Track winrate in bb/100 and in currency/hour; choose stakes that maximize both with acceptable variance.

Mini example
Online 50NL uses 5% rake with a 2.50 cap. Heads-up pot to the flop reaches 50bb quickly; past that, extra chips are not raked. A 33% c-bet may be thin in theory but becomes worse if the pot is still under the cap and you are bluffing too much. Live 1/3 takes 10% up to $7. Multiway limped pots get shaved hard; raising to isolate two players, then value-betting bigger, reaches the cap and protects your edge.

Common mistakes

* Ignoring the cap and playing a tiny-pot style that lets rake eat small wins.
* Copying solver lines built for rake-free or low-rake environments.
* Moving up only by ego. Some 1/2 live games are higher-rake than 2/5 and play worse.
