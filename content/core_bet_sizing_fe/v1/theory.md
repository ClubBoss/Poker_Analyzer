What it is
This module teaches bet sizing: when to use small, medium, large, or overbet sizes, how polar vs merge ranges affect sizing, and how to set frequencies that fit texture and opponent tendencies. You will connect size to purpose instead of guessing.

Why it matters
Your size controls price, fold equity, and pot growth. Good sizing pressures the right part of the opponent's range and lets your value hands win bigger pots. Poor sizing burns chips, leaves money on the table, or gives opponents free chances to realize equity.

Rules of thumb
- Small bets (25-33% pot) on static boards with range advantage. Why: they fold out air cheaply, keep worse hands in against merged value, and protect your checking range.
- Medium bets (40-60% pot) when you want two streets on mixed textures. Why: enough denial and value without over-polarizing, and future sizing stays flexible.
- Large bets (66-100% pot) on dynamic textures or with high equity hands and bluffs. Why: charge draws, simplify later streets, and make folds from middling pairs.
- Overbet (125-200% pot) when you are polar and villain is capped. Why: maximize value with nutted hands and apply max pressure to bluffcatchers.
- Pair size with range shape. Polar uses large or overbet; merge uses small or medium. Mixing the wrong size with the wrong shape leaks value and clarity.

Mini example
UTG opens, BTN calls, blinds fold. Flop K72 rainbow. UTG has range advantage and bets small, about 33% pot; BTN calls with second pair and backdoors. Turn 5 brings straight draws; UTG moves to a medium size near 60% to charge draws while keeping value from worse Kx. River bricks; UTG polarizes with an overbet using strong Kx and better as value, and missed draws as bluffs, while checking medium strength. The size shifts track range shape and texture across streets.

Common mistakes
- One-size-fits-all c-bets. Why it is a mistake: textures differ, so your price should too. Why it happens: habit and speed over thinking.
- Using big sizes with merged value. Why it is a mistake: worse folds and better calls. Why it happens: desire to "protect" without real threats.
- Bluffing large without blockers or a cap read. Why it is a mistake: you target too many strong calls. Why it happens: focusing on your hand, not ranges.

Mini-glossary
Polar: Range of very strong hands and bluffs, suited to large or overbet sizes.
Merge: Range of many medium strength value hands that want calls from worse, suited to small or medium sizes.
Frequency: How often you choose a line across similar spots to stay coherent and balanced.
Overbet: A bet larger than the pot, used mainly with polar ranges when villain is capped.

Contrast
Unlike core_equity_realization, which explains how position, SPR, and texture affect how much equity you realize, this module shows how to choose sizes that drive folds, calls, and pot growth to meet your plan.
