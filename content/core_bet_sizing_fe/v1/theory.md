What it is
Bet sizing and fold equity (FE) map your bet to expected folds and value capture. For a pure bluff, breakeven FE = bet / (pot + bet). For value, larger sizes earn more chips from worse hands if they still call often enough. Your aim is to pick sizes that fit your range and villain tendencies.

Why it matters
Size is a lever. Too small and you give cheap cards and miss value. Too big and you fold out the hands you target or burn chips when bluffing. Understanding FE math and polarization lets you simplify decisions, print with small bets on good boards, and apply pressure with credible large bets.

Rules of thumb

* On dry, range-advantage boards, small c-bets work: they risk little and achieve enough FE.
* Use big sizes with polarized ranges or on wet boards that need protection.
* For a bluff, estimate FE quickly: need around 33% for half-pot, 40% for two-thirds, 50% for pot.
* Block-bet small in position with medium hands to set a cheap price and avoid facing huge bets.
* When you lack nutted hands, avoid massive sizes; prefer checks or small bets.

Mini example
Pot 12bb. You consider bluffing 4bb on the flop. Breakeven FE = 4 / (12 + 4) = 25%. If you expect folds 35%+, bluff is +EV. With a merged value hand like second pair, a 33% pot bet gains value from worse pairs and denies overcards. On a wet board, you switch to 75% with strong value and best bluffs.

Common mistakes

* Mixing sizes without a reason, creating ranges that are easy to exploit.
* Bluffing big when you have few natural bluffs or poor blockers.
* Value-betting small with hands that beat many calls and should go bigger.
