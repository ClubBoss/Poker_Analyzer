What it is
Three-bet pots start when someone re-raises preflop and is called. Ranges are tighter and stack-to-pot ratio (SPR) is lower. Small mistakes are amplified because turn and river arrive with larger pot shares and fewer chips behind.

Why it matters
3-bet pots create big pots fast. Correct size selection and combo choice deliver clean value and disciplined bluffs. You must respect position: in-position has control and realizes equity; out-of-position needs clearer value and better blockers to continue.

Rules of thumb

* Use small c-bets in 3-bet pots as the aggressor on many boards; ranges are strong and SPR is low.
* Bluff less and value-bet thinner in position; out of position check more and choose larger polar bets.
* On A-high and K-high dry flops, the 3-bettor often has nut advantage; small bets perform well.
* Avoid wide floats OOP; prefer raise-or-fold with strong draws and pairs that benefit from protection.
* Preflop, select 3-bet bluffs with blockers (Axs, Kxs) and value hands that dominate calls.

Mini example
BTN 3-bets SB, SB calls. Flop K72r. BTN has range and nut advantage. Small c-bet (25-33%) with Kx, AA, and some AQ/AJ backdoors works. SB continues with Kx, pairs, and the best backdoors; folds most air. On QJTs two-tone, ranges narrow to strong pairs and draws; BTN checks more and sizes up when betting. River decisions polarize: choose bluffs that block calls.

Common mistakes

* Using large c-bets by default and burning EV with merged hands at low SPR.
* Calling 3-bets OOP with dominated offsuit Broadways that realize poorly.
* Barreling turn bricks automatically; pick cards that favor your range or add equity.
