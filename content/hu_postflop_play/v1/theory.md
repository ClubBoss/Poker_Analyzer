What it is
Heads-up postflop is high-frequency, high-aggression poker where ranges are wide and position changes everything. The SB acts last on all postflop streets. Small bets on dry boards, pressure on favorable textures, and thin value with top pairs are standard. Blockers and backdoors matter for bluff selection.

Why it matters
In HU, many pots are decided with one bet because ranges are weak and uncapped. Small, repeatable edges accumulate quickly. A tight, phone-friendly plan—one small size, one big size, clear value/bluff sets—keeps execution simple while exploiting opponents who overfold or overcall.

Rules of thumb
* Use small c-bets often on Axx/Kxx/Qxx dry boards as the raiser; size up on wet/low boards that favor the caller.
* In position, value-bet thin and stab often when checked to; out of position, protect your check range and avoid autopiloting big bluffs.
* Favor bluffs with two overcards, backdoor flush/straight draws, or strong blockers; avoid zero-equity spews.
* Barrel good turn cards for your range and cards that reduce their calling combos; slow down on bricks that improve them.
* River: bluff with hands that block calls and do not block folds; value-bet hands that beat their bluff-catchers, not just their bluffs.

Mini example
SB opens, BB calls. Flop K72r. SB has range advantage. Small c-bet (25–33%) with Kx, QQ–TT, and bluffs like A5s/QJs backdoor. Turn 9 adds gutters to QJ and T8; SB barrels more with Kx, sets, and A5s with BDFD. River 2 pairs the board. SB value-bets thin with KQ/KJ and checks back marginal sevens. As BB versus a small c-bet on 954ss, continue with pairs, OESDs, and BDFDs; fold low-equity air.

Common mistakes
* Using large bets by default and overbluffing textures that favor the defender.
* Calling down without blockers versus river polar bets from tight opponents.
* Splitting into too many sizes and losing track mid-hand, especially on mobile.
