What it is
Multiway pots involve three or more players to the flop. Equity is shared across more ranges, so single-pair hands drop in value and bluffs succeed less often. Lines must respect compounded odds, position, and who can profitably apply pressure.

Why it matters
Most live cash games create many multiway flops due to limps and small 3-bets. Strategy that prints heads-up can burn money multiway. You must choose stronger value, cleaner draws, and tighter bluffing rules. Correct sizing and discipline protect your win rate under higher variance.

Rules of thumb
* Value up, bluff down: bet thinner heads-up, but in multiway favor strong top pairs+, big draws, and sets.
* Position is king: IP can realize equity and pick sizes; OOP checks more and avoids thin stabs.
* Size honestly: small on dry textures, bigger for protection on wet boards; avoid huge bluffs without nut equity.
* Respect overcalls: each caller improves others' pot odds; require higher equity to continue.
* Deny equity with combo draws; check medium hands that hate raises and cannot barrel many turns.

Mini example
UTG limps, MP calls, CO raises 4x, BTN and blinds call, limpers call. Flop K97 two-tone, five-way. CO should not range c-bet. Prefer checking many Kx without strong kicker, bet bigger with sets and KQ+, and add only premium draws as bluffs. BTN facing a 50% pot bet and two calls needs much stronger equity than in heads-up: strong Kx, NFDs, OESDs with overcards. Weak backdoors fold. On a brick turn after flop checks through, BTN can value-bet thinner IP because ranges capped.

Common mistakes
* Autopiloting small c-bets into four players and getting peeled by dominated hands and draws.
* Calling once with weak pairs that face frequent squeezes behind and bad turn playability.
* Over-bluffing turns when ranges are sticky and raise frequencies punish thin barrels.
