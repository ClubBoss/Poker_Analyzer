What it is
ICM (Independent Chip Model) converts tournament chips into payout equity ($EV). It values survival and laddering: the next chip you gain is worth less than the last, and busting costs more than in chip-EV (cEV) models. ICM creates a “risk premium” that tightens calls and widens well-chosen shoves.

Why it matters
Most pivotal spots near bubbles and final tables are not cEV. Calling off light can torch many buy-ins of $EV even if it wins chips often. Using ICM logic protects your stack when covered, targets stacks that must fold, and turns pressure into profit without heroics.

Rules of thumb

* Covered vs covering: when an opponent covers you, your call ranges tighten most; when you cover, pressure them with opens and 3-bets.
* Calls tighten first, shoves second: risk premium makes calling all-ins worse than shoving into folds.
* Attack middling stacks near bubbles; they fear busting more than chip leaders or micro stacks.
* Open smaller with ICM pressure to risk less when folded or jammed on.
* Pay jumps shape risk: the bigger the jump, the tighter you should continue without strong blockers or nutted hands.

Mini example
Nine left, eight paid. You have 22bb, BTN covers with 60bb, blinds 18bb/12bb. BTN opens 2.1x. AJo is a clear cEV defend, but ICM risk premium is high because BTN covers and can barrel you off. Best adjustment: 3-bet small or fold more often than cEV would say; call less. If SB jams 12bb and you cover, AQo and 88+ call; ATo that is a cEV call may become an ICM fold when the bubble is steep.

Common mistakes

* Using chip-EV push/call charts during bubbles or pay jumps.
* Ignoring who covers whom and calling off versus stacks that can bust you.
* Passing on profitable steals as the big stack; pressure belongs to you when you cover the table.
