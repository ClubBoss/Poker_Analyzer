What it is
This module teaches flop play through range-vs-range thinking, c-bet types, board categories, and baseline sizings. You will learn when to cbet_small or cbet_big, when to check_back or delay_cbet, and how to react to probe_bet, donk_bet, and raise_flop.

Why it matters
Strong flop decisions compound edge. Knowing which side has range_advantage or nut_advantage lets you pick sizes that pressure wide parts of the pool and avoid paying off on bad textures. Clear rules reduce guesswork on dry_board and wet_board and prevent common traps.

Rules of thumb
- Dry_board + range_advantage -> cbet_small. On K72 rainbow the preflop raiser holds more top pairs and broadways; a small bet (25-33%, typical online) taxes floats and denies overcards.
- Wet_board or two_tone with many high-equity draws -> cbet_big. On T98 two_tone or QJT two_tone the caller has robust draws; larger bets (60-100%, typical online) deny equity and build for value.
- Monotone or paired_board lower value margins. Mix check_back with medium hands and delay_cbet turns that add equity or unblock folds.
- Do not donk_bet often. Lead only when the caller's range gains nut_advantage (e.g., BB defend on 872 two_tone vs CO) or when the preflop raiser capped by checking back.
- Raise_flop with strong value and with high-equity bluffs on dynamic textures; prefer float_call in position versus small cbets when many good turn cards exist.

Mini example
UTG opens, BTN calls, blinds fold. Flop K72 rainbow (dry_board). UTG owns range_advantage and chooses cbet_small. BTN float_call with backdoor straight and flush potential. Turn 5 offsuit changes little; UTG fires small again, BTN folds. If UTG had checked flop, delay_cbet on many turns recovers fold equity while protecting the checking range.

Common mistakes
- Betting big on static boards without nut edge. Mistake: overvaluing medium strength. Why it happens: equating size with strength regardless of texture.
- Auto-cbetting on monotone or paired_board with no key blockers. Mistake: folding out worse and getting called by better. Why it happens: habits from dry_board spots.
- Calling flop raises with weak one-pair on wet_board. Mistake: too many bad turns and rivers. Why it happens: fear of folding the best hand and ignoring equity denial.

Mini-glossary
Range vs range: Evaluate how two preflop ranges connect with a board, not just your hand.
Range_advantage: One range holds more top pairs/strong hands on a texture.
Nut_advantage: One range holds more nut or near-nut combos on a texture.
Board categories: dry_board, wet_board, two_tone, monotone, paired_board that guide sizing and aggression.
Float_call: In-position call versus small c-bet planning to realize equity or bluff good turns.
Donk_bet: Out-of-position lead into the aggressor; use sparingly and only with a range reason.

Contrast
Unlike core_starting_hands, which chooses preflop holdings, this module shows how board texture and range edges drive c-bet choices and reactions on the flop.
