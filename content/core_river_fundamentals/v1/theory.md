What it is
This module explains river strategy: when to value_bet or bluff, how to choose bet_small_river, bet_big_river, or overbet_river, how blockers shape a blocker_bluff, when to bluffcatch, and the correct showdown flow.

Why it matters
The river locks equities and concentrates chips. One sizing or one call decides sessions. Clear rules for polarize vs thin_value reduce fear-based choices and turn close spots into repeatable, profitable decisions.

Rules of thumb
- Polarize on blanks. When draws miss and you own nut advantage, prefer bet_big_river or overbet_river with your best value and best bluffs; middling hands fold and strong ones pay. Why: big sizes pressure bluffcatchers.
- Thin value in position. Versus wide caller pools, use bet_small_river with top pair or second pair that can be called by worse. Why: small sizing widens the call range.
- Choose bluffs with blockers. Favor blocker_bluff when you block their calls (e.g., ace of the flush suit) and do not block their folds. Why: better card removal raises fold equity.
- Default checks with marginal showdown. If worse rarely calls and better rarely folds, check_back IP or check OOP. Why: thin bet gets called too strong; you realize equity by checking.
- Bluffcatch selectively. Call when price is good and villain is polarized with enough missed draws; otherwise check_fold. Why: calling without outs is pure frequency math.
- Showdown flow. After a called river bet, bettor_shows_first. If the river checks through, first_active_left_of_btn_shows. Why: action determines reveal order.

Mini example
CO opens, BTN calls, blinds fold. Flop and turn: CO bets, BTN calls. River bricks the front-door draw. CO holds top set; BTN's range holds many missed draws and some one-pair. CO polarizes with overbet_river; BTN tank-calls as a bluffcatch and loses. Because the river bet was called, bettor_shows_first, then the caller may muck or show. If both had checked, first_active_left_of_btn_shows.

Common mistakes
- Betting medium strength too large. Why it is a mistake: worse folds and better calls, losing value. Why it happens: desire to "end it" with a big bet.
- Bluffing without good blockers. Why it is a mistake: you block folds and leave in calls. Why it happens: focusing on your hand, not their calling range.
- Passing thin_value. Why it is a mistake: small pots add up; automatic check_back surrenders equity. Why it happens: fear of a check_raise and overestimating villain strength.

Mini-glossary
Polarize: Play a range of very strong value and air with large sizes that pressure bluffcatchers.
Thin_value: A small value_bet intended to be called by slightly worse hands.
Blocker_bluff: A bluff chosen because your cards block calls and do not block folds.
Bluffcatch: A call with a medium-strength hand that aims only to beat bluffs.

Contrast
Unlike core_turn_fundamentals, which plans geometry and second barrels, this module focuses on final-street sizing, value vs bluff decisions, blocker-driven bluffs, disciplined bluffcatching, and correct showdown flow.

_This module uses the fixed families and sizes: size_down_dry, size_up_wet; small_cbet_33, half_pot_50, big_bet_75._
