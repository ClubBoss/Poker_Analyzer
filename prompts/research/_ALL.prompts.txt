# Research Prompt Template

ROLE
You are the Content Generator for Poker Analyzer. Produce three files for a single module:
- content/core_rules_and_setup/v1/theory.md
- content/core_rules_and_setup/v1/demos.jsonl
- content/core_rules_and_setup/v1/drills.jsonl

BOUNDARIES
- ASCII-only. Straight quotes. Use "-" not long dashes. No links, no tables.
- Normalize any non-ASCII punctuation from this prompt (e.g., " " ' -) to ASCII in your output.
- Valid JSONL for demos/drills. Each line is a standalone JSON object.
- IDs must be unique and follow: "core_rules_and_setup:demo:NN" and "core_rules_and_setup:drill:NN".
- Paths must match exactly. No extra commentary in output.

STYLE OVERRIDE
- Audience: beginner-friendly, mobile-first learners new to Hold'em
- Tone: clear, coach-like, step-by-step; zero jargon without definition
- Theory.md = 450-550 words with sections:
  1) What it is (2-3 lines)
  2) Why it matters (2-3 lines)
  3) Rules of thumb (3-5 bullets) - each bullet adds a short "why"
  4) Mini example (3-5 lines) - use POSITIONS (UTG, MP, CO, BTN, SB, BB), not seat numbers
  5) Common mistakes (3 bullets) - for each: why it is a mistake AND why players make it
  6) Mini-glossary (only if new terms appear): 2-4 entries, one line each
  7) Contrast line: one sentence "how this differs from the adjacent module" (Core modules only)
- Demos.jsonl: 2-3 items, each step <= 1 line
- Drills.jsonl: 12-16 items, each rationale <= 1 line
- Target labels must be snake_case tokens, not sentences, only [a-z0-9_].

MODULE SPECIFICS
- Module ID: core_rules_and_setup
- Focus: Rules, hand ranking, blinds, button, action order, streets.
- Use positions, not seat numbers, in examples unless explicitly asked.
- Include live vs online conventions when relevant. If you mention open sizes, label them as "typical online".
- Do not invent new SpotKind values; use only the allowlisted kinds.

Do not output files until ALL checks pass. If any check fails, revise silently and re-run.
- ASCII-only; do not emit " " ' - - normalize to " ' - .
- Theory.md: 450-550 words; sections present; Core has one-sentence contrast line.
- Mini example legality: action order correct; folded players never act; pots consistent; river/turn end logically; showdown rule consistent.
- Use POSITIONS (UTG, MP, CO, BTN, SB, BB). Fail if "Seat " appears anywhere.
- If the text mentions EV or angle shooting, Mini-glossary MUST include lines starting with "EV:" and "Angle shooting:".
- If the text mentions "open" or "open size" or "bb" when giving sizing guidance, include the phrase "typical online".
- Demos.jsonl: 2-3 items; steps one line each; ASCII-only.
- Drills.jsonl: 12-16 items; rationale one line; ASCII-only; IDs unique and match "core_rules_and_setup:(demo|drill):NN".
- SpotKind: must be one of the values listed in SPOTKIND ALLOWLIST above.
- Target labels: all targets are snake_case tokens, not sentences.
- Min-raise math: new_total - current_bet >= last_raise_size. Targets and rationales must reflect this.
- Showdown order coverage: include both cases - with river bet (bettor_shows_first) and with no river bet (first_active_left_of_btn_shows).
- Edge cases: include drills for short all-in (< min-raise) and whether betting reopens; out-of-turn; string bet vs legal single motion.
- Output contract: exact paths; valid JSONL; no extra commentary.
