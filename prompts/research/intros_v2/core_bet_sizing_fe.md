# core_bet_sizing_fe â€” Research Intro (v2)

Focus: Bet size selection by objective (value/deny/polarize) and how size affects fold equity.

Goal
- Define thin_value vs polar_value and when to bet_small / bet_big / overbet.
- Link size -> target range (what folds/calls/continues).
- Include flop/turn/river contrasts for FE behavior.

Must include
- Key terms: fold_equity, thin_value, polarize, bet_small, bet_big, overbet.
- "typical online" size bands (25-33%, 50-66%, 75-100%+).

Do/Don't examples
- Do: "Wet board + nut advantage -> bigger size for denial."
- Don't: "Big size means strong" without range context.

Quality bars
- ASCII-only; concise, actionable bullets.

Common traps to avoid
- Giving sizes without 'why/target'.
- Same size on all textures.
