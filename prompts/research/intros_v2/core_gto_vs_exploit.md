# core_gto_vs_exploit â€” Research Intro (v2)

Focus: Baseline GTO principles vs targeted exploits; when to deviate and how to quantify.

Goal
- Define GTO_baseline, exploit, pool_tendency, node_lock (conceptually).
- Examples: overfolding nodes, overcalling rivers, sizing tells.
- Show safe exploits with minimal backfire risk.

Must include
- Key terms: gto_baseline, exploit, pool_read, node.
- Stress: start from baseline, deviate with evidence.

Do/Don't examples
- Do: "Pool overfolds to overbets on blanks -> increase bluff rate."
- Don't: Deviate without a read/sample.

Quality bars
- ASCII-only; practical, not solver-heavy.

Common traps to avoid
- Treating 'GTO' as a set of lines rather than ranges.
