# core_mental_game â€” Research Intro (v2)

Focus: Tilt control, routines, A-game/B-game/C-game awareness, session hygiene.

Goal
- Pre-/mid-/post-session checklists.
- Triggers and interrupt routines (breath, pause, timebank).
- Metrics: focus, emotion, decision quality, stop-loss rules.

Must include
- Key terms: tilt, a_game, c_game, stop_loss, warmup, cooldown.
- Simple in-app drills (1-2 min).

Do/Don't examples
- Do: "2-deep breaths + stand-up after bad beat before next hand."
- Don't: Generic motivation; keep it operational.

Quality bars
- ASCII-only; short bullets, zero fluff.

Common traps to avoid
- Vague advice without triggers/actions.
