# core_equity_realization â€” Research Intro (v2)

Focus: How position, initiative, sizing, and board texture affect realized equity vs raw equity.

Goal
- Show why IP realizes more equity than OOP and how initiative shifts realization.
- Map when small vs big bets increase realization for value/draws.
- Connect texture (static/dynamic) to realization (free cards vs denial).

Must include
- Key terms: equity_realization, deny_equity, realize_equity, IP, OOP.
- Do: tie examples to "typical online" sizings.
- Don't: equate raw equity with EV; emphasize realization pathways.

Do/Don't examples
- Do: "IP with combo draw realizes well vs small size; prefer call."
- Don't: "Always raise draws" (depends on realization and fold equity).

Quality bars
- ASCII-only, straight quotes.
- Mobile-length bullets, beginner-friendly.

Common traps to avoid
- Vague "equity" talk without realization mechanics.
- Ignoring position/initiative in examples.
