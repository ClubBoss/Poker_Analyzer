# core_check_raise_systems â€” Research Intro (v2)

Focus: When and why to check-raise for value/bluff, size selection, and range construction.

Goal
- Show value buckets vs bluff buckets (blockers/backdoors).
- Size guidance: small XR vs jam on dynamic boards.
- IP/OOP reactions to XR (call/3bet/fold) with reasons.

Must include
- Key terms: check_raise, backdoor_equity, blockers, range_cap.
- Preferred spotkinds: l2_flop_xr, l2_turn_xr (if used elsewhere keep naming consistent).

Do/Don't examples
- Do: "OOP XR on 872 two_tone: sets/2p + BDFD gutters as bluffs."
- Don't: XR weak one-pair on wet boards without plan.

Quality bars
- ASCII-only; beginner tone.

Common traps to avoid
- XR frequency advice without textures/line plans.
