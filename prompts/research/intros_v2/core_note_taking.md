# core_note_taking â€” Research Intro (v2)

Focus: Efficient notes, tags, and heuristics to capture pool reads and exploits.

Goal
- Define note structure: spot, villain tendency, evidence, exploit.
- Provide tag set and quick abbreviations.
- Show examples: river_overfold, small_blind_limp, fast_play_nuts.

Must include
- Key terms: tag, read, timestamp, sample_size.
- Stress clarity and actionability; avoid novels.

Do/Don't examples
- Do: "BB: overfold vs 75% river on blanks (n=6) -> overbet more."
- Don't: "Villain bad" style notes.

Quality bars
- ASCII-only; one-line templates suited for mobile copy.

Common traps to avoid
- Notes without next-step exploit.
