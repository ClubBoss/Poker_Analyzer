IMAGES / AUTO-PLACEHOLDERS (must)
- In theory.md insert 2â€“3 inline placeholders as single lines: @@img:<id>@@
- Choose spots among: after_why_it_matters, before_mini_example, after_rules_of_thumb.
- For this module include at least one positions diagram.
- Also emit content/<module_id>/v1/images.json listing objects:
  {"id":"<id>","slot":"<one of spots above>","alt":"<short alt text>"}
- ids in theory.md MUST match ids in images.json. No real images, placeholders only.
- If unsure, still include one positions placeholder.
