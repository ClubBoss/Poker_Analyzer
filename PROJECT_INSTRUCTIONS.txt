# Project Instructions — Poker Analyzer

1. **SSOT for curriculum** is CURRICULUM_STRUCTURE.md (v3.1).  
2. All generation flows (Research, Zip, Codex) must use this file as the single source of truth.  

3. **Flow**
- Core is mandatory.  
- After Core → branch into Cash or MTT.  
- Heads-Up (HU) is a separate optional path.  
- Math is a separate optional path.  
- Live/Online/Cross modules are side-branches.  

4. **Style Rules**
- Research must adapt STYLE OVERRIDE per batch.  
- Use simple language, explain every term (no jargon without definition).  
- Always include “why it matters” and “why this mistake is common” in bullets.  
- Distinguish Live vs Online dynamics where relevant.  
- Math path: gradual, beginner-friendly, step-by-step.  

5. **Quality Gates**
- ASCII-only (7-bit).  
- JSONL strictly valid, unique IDs.  
- Run `dart run tooling/content_audit.dart` locally; deliver only if all checks = OK.  

6. **Chats**
- Research chat: generates content.  
- Zip chat: packages ZIP, provides pipeline commands.  
- PM/Advisor chat: tracks roadmap, status, and next prompts.
